# Threat Compass

Threat Compass is a cutting-edge cybersecurity tool designed to provide real-time threat data collection and analysis. It leverages web scraping techniques to gather information on over 2500 malware and 400 threat actors. By using YARA rules, ThreatCompass has collected over 1000 validated malicious indicators, enabling efficient threat profiling with an 80% increased effectiveness.

The tool amplifies threat profiling by 50% by facilitating the identification of malicious software and TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) employed by threat actors through the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This comprehensive approach allows for a more in-depth understanding of cyber threats and their potential impact on organizations.

In addition to threat profiling, ThreatCompass distributes over 200 recent cyber news and CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) reports, enabling stakeholders to identify and respond to threats more effectively. By staying up-to-date with the latest cybersecurity vulnerabilities, organizations can better protect their digital assets and mitigate potential risks.
